About
=====

The ``scousepy`` package provides a method by which a large amount of complex
astronomical spectral line data can be fitted in a systematic way.

A description of the method and original [IDL version](https://github.com/jdhenshaw/SCOUSE) of the code
can be found in [Henshaw et al. 2016](http://ukads.nottingham.ac.uk/abs/2016arXiv160103732H).
In this repo we include data and analysis scripts for the tutorials located
[here](http://scousepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).
